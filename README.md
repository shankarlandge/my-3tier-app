# My 3-Tier Application

This is a simple **3-tier architecture application** project designed to demonstrate modern software deployment using **Docker** and optionally on **AWS**.

---I recently developed a 3-tier architecture application, where I used Java (Spring Boot) for the backend, designed a modern 3D-style website for the frontend, and deployed everything on AWS.

One unique feature is that I integrated my LinkedIn profile directly into the website, so visitors can instantly view and connect with me.


## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Frontend:** React / HTML-CSS (static or dynamic UI)
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL

It follows the classic 3-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend)** â€” User interface that interacts with backend via APIs.
2. **Application Tier (Backend)** â€” Handles business logic and API processing.
3. **Data Tier (Database)** â€” Stores application data.
